Discord bot for easy, chat-based drafting. Inspired by our friend group not being able to decide on a game to play :)

You'll need to grant the bot access to your Discord server: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html

Once done, create a file named ".env" of the following form: 
DISCORD_TOKEN=[your token]<br\>
DISCORD_GUILD=[your server name]
